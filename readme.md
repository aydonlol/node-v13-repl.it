# [Discord.js template for replit](https://repl.it/github/neumatic-org/djs-v12-replit)  
[![](https://replit.com/badge/github/neumatic-org/djs-v12.replit.png)](https://repl.it/github/neumatic-org/djs-v12-replit)  
Replit's version of node is outdated, and the new version of discord.js requires node v16 and intents. There is a workaround to getting updated node on replit, that i made.

## how to use:
press the run button, it should take a few seconds (install discord.js, make a package.json, remove license+readme, and add main.sh) , and then exit, then press it again (make sure to fill in the TOKEN env!) and your bot should be logged in.
